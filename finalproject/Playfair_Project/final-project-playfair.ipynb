    "This choice for the final project will focus on the [Playfair cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher).\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia:\n",
    ">The technique encrypts pairs of letters (bigrams or digrams), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher and rather more complex Vigenère cipher systems then in use. The Playfair is thus significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it. The frequency analysis of bigrams is possible, but considerably more difficult. With 600 possible bigrams rather than the 26 possible monograms (single symbols, usually letters in this context), a considerably larger cipher text is required in order to be useful.\n",

    "The Playfair cipher uses a Polybius square as the substitution key, similar to the ADFGVX and bifid ciphers.\n",

    "From Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Polybius square, also known as the Polybius checkerboard, is a device invented by the ancient Greeks Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and made famous by the historian and scholar Polybius. The device is used for fractionating plaintext characters so that they can be represented by a smaller set of symbols, which is useful for telegraphy, steganography, and cryptography. The device was originally used for fire signalling, allowing for the coded transmission of any message, not just a finite amount of predetermined options as was the convention before.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Polybius square, first create an empty 5x5 grid. Then, fill it with each of the 26 English characters, with `I` and `J` sharing a square (`I` is only shown when displayed). There are $25!$ different ways to fill the square, which makes it very unlikely that someone would be able to guess your key at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, a keyword is often used to create the square. The letters of the key (without duplicates) are placed from left to right starting in the top row, moving from top to bottom. When the letters in the keyword are used up, the rest of the alphabet follows in regular order. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the keyword `playfair example` would result in square below, where duplicate letters are omitted from the square, but still shown in red:\n",

The first rule can only be reversed by dropping any extra instances of the chosen insert letter, `X`, that do not make sense in the final message when finished. This is typically done by hand."
