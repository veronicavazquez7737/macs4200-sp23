    "1. **Choose a book to work with**. Navigate to the Top 100 downloaded books section (https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top) and find a book that calls to you. Click on the list for the book to load the information page for that specific book.\n",
    "2. **Download a copy of the book** You'll see that each book is available in a few different formats. You could view in HTML (for your web browser), EPUB (for your eBook reader), or Plain Text UTF-8 (a .txt file for your Python notebook). You should right click on the link for the Plain Text UTF-8 .txt file and save it to your local computer. You can open it on your computer to verify it downloaded correctly, it should open in Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).\n",
    "3. **Upload the text file to the activities folder** in your course folder on Datahub (where this file is)\n",
    "4. **Load the text in the file as a string** (refer back to Lab 02 to see how to do this)."

Now's a good time to catch up!). Modifying your Caesar function to encrypt a message for the Affine cipher should only involve taking in another parameter (for the multiplicative key) and then using that key with some multiplication inside the encryption loop. You don't need to have the function decipher messages for this activity, but you *could* think about how you'd do that. I'd try to use the `mult_inverse` function you wrote in Activity 10 to help out!\n"
